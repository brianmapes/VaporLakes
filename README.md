# VaporLakes
Code to track atmospheric vapor lakes that cross east African coastlines

Next, gather gridded data in "buffers" by distance from the lake boundary. Useful tool here is rioxarray, example is here https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/328128/extracting-data-within-geometry-shape/328320#328320

I don't THINK I have to go all the way to OSGEO packages, as exampled here https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/354782/masking-netcdf-time-series-data-from-shapefile-using-python/354798#354798
